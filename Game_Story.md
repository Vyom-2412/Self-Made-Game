A test run for the newly developed chemical formula was going on in the laboratory of the military base. Scientists belieeved that if this compound was to be successful, it could take modern medicine to a whole new level. During the tests, the compund showed excellent results with test dummies. People thought that it could even be added to the periodic table! But then, everything changed when they brought a real test subject. They infused the compound with the subject's blood. The results were excellent but soon, the subject reported dizziness and weakness. After a few minutes, the subject fainted. The chemical compound was discarded and the laab was shut down. Two weeks after the incident, the guards who were patrolling the perimeter around the laboratory heard something inside. When they went in, they saw that the lab was destryed which was impossible since the lab was shut down with everything inside it intact. Then....they heard a low growl followed by footsteps. It was the subject who had his bood infused with the chemical....except...he was no more human. News got out that the subject had escaped the military base and was now free. He could be anywhere...hunting for blood.....
